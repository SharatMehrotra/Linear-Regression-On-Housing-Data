# Linear-Regression-On-Housing-Data
Linear Regression along with data scaling performed on a .csv file containing data from various house.
Libraries such as numpy, pandas scikit learn and matplotlib have been used. 
Since the R square value comes out to be ~0.65, we can conclude that linear regression isn't the best model to fit the data since it covers only 65% of the variance
